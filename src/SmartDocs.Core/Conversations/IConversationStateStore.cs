/// <summary>
/// The persistence seam for multi-turn conversation state (Ch 25 §"Conversation
/// state persistence"). A RAG agent that holds a session — the running message
/// thread, tool-call state, retrieved-context cursor — needs that state to
/// survive between HTTP requests and across instances behind a load balancer.
/// This port stores an already-serialized session blob keyed by an opaque
/// conversation id, with a time-to-live.
///
/// <para>
/// Two implementations ship: an in-memory store (<c>InMemoryConversationStateStore</c>,
/// the default and the one tests use) and a Redis-backed
/// <c>IDistributedCache</c> store (<c>DistributedConversationStateStore</c> in
/// SmartDocs.Performance — the hot store). Redis is the hot tier; the durable
/// tier is Cosmos DB behind the same seam (the Bicep provisions a Cosmos account
/// for exactly this), swapped in without touching any caller. The contract is
/// deliberately string-in/string-out so the agent layer owns serialization and
/// this seam never takes a dependency on a thread/agent type.

/// <para>
/// The TTL is not a cache-tuning knob — it is the <em>retention boundary</em>.
/// It must be derived from the tenant's consent / data-retention policy (Ch 24
/// trust-by-design): a conversation may only be persisted as long as the
/// principal has consented to its retention. Callers pass the consent-derived
/// TTL on every <see cref="SetAsync"/>; an erasure request (Ch 24
/// <c>ErasureReceipt</c>) maps to <see cref="DeleteAsync"/>.
