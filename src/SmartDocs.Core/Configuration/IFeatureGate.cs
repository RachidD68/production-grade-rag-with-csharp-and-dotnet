/// A minimal runtime feature-flag / configuration seam (Ch 25 §"Feature flags /
/// runtime config"). Lets a request-time branch — turn reranking on, switch
/// retrieval strategy, route to a different model — be toggled by configuration
/// rather than a redeploy. Two members: a boolean flag check and a typed value
/// read.

/// <para>
/// The shipped implementation (<see cref="ConfigurationFeatureGate"/>) reads from
/// <c>IConfiguration</c> under a <c>Features</c> section, which is enough for the
/// book's purposes and works offline with zero infrastructure. In a managed
/// deployment the same seam is backed by <strong>Azure App Configuration</strong>
/// with its feature-management store — flags flip centrally and propagate to every
/// instance without a redeploy, and percentage/targeting filters become available
/// (the Ch 25 Bicep provisions the App Configuration resource). That swap happens
/// behind this interface: <c>Microsoft.FeatureManagement</c> /
/// <c>Microsoft.Azure.AppConfiguration.AspNetCore</c> are deliberately NOT
/// referenced here, keeping the core package dependency-free.
